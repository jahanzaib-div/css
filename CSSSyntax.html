    <h1>A CSS rule consists of a selector and a declaration block.</h1>

    <p>The selector points to the HTML element you want to style.

        The declaration block contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons.
        
        Each declaration includes a CSS property name and a value, separated by a colon.
        
        Multiple CSS declarations are separated with semicolons, and declaration blocks are surrounded by curly braces.</p>
